How to clear the totalizer:

1. Unlock settings: write 9001 to holding register 219
2. Clear the totalizer: write 3 to holding register 211
3. Write 500 to register 500

Note:
Once you unlock the meter, you can change multiple parameters via the commands.
When you are done making changes, write 500 to register 500 to save and reboot.
The meter will be locked after writing 500.  If you want to make additional
changes, you must unlock the meter again.
